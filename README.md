## *Project 1: Movie recommendation engine system based on emotions*
*Final Capstone Project in collaboration with [MAGID]( https://magid.com/ )* 

As project leader of a team of 4, I led the development of new film genres and a movie recommendation app based on emotions. Using original survey data collected by MAGID on the emotional responses of respondents after watching a movie and other demographic data, we achieved over 80% of accuracy on the XGBoost model and various exciting insights.
The project steps were:

- Creating new metrics based on emotions using correlations and factor analysis;
-	Creation of new movie genres based on emotions rather than contents using clustering algorithms;
-	Inspect what the emotions that affect most the rating are, using correlations and feature importance from XGBoost;
-	Working with real survey data supplied by MAGID on perceived emotional responses by the users and demographic data (age, income, etc.)
-	Customer segmentation looking at customer habits;
-	Using Python programming for clustering and building a model to predict good and bad ratings;

## *Project 2:Insights on ALS and other rare diseases through open data*
*Project for Hackathon 2021 at Seneca College, in collaboration with [Orphadata](http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/index.php)*

Orphadata provides the scientific community with data about rare diseases. In this challenge, we had to retrieve data about rare diseases to gain insights and develop an application to assist doctors and researchers with diagnosing rare diseases. The challenge involved:

- Massive data Cleaning and extraction from XML file; 
- Data Analysis using Python programming language; 
- Creation of an application to run the analysis.

## *Project 3:Application of statistical machine learning algorithms in football matches*
Master’s degree thesis at University of Turin, in collaboration with [OPTA Sport](https://www.optasports.com/)
I created a model to predict the outcome of a match using metrics related to a team’s network and playstyle with 85% of accuracy. OPTA sport provided high-quality data about games of the Italian championship season 2012/2013. 
• Data extraction from XML files and data cleaning; 
• Building adjacency matrices for each team and metrics related to network and playstyle implemented in several papers of statistics and sport;
• Developing and tuning several machine learning algorithms in the R programming language to predict the outcome of a match. The best one was a SVM model.
