# Project 1: Movie recommendation engine system based on emotions
[Final Capstone Project in collaboration with MAGID]( https://magid.com/ )

As project leader of a team of 4, I led the development of new film genres and a movie recommendation app based on emotions. Using original survey data collected by MAGID on the emotional responses of respondents after watching a movie and other demographic data, we achieved over 80% of accuracy on the XGBoost model and various exciting insights.
The project involved:

•	Creating new metrics based on emotions using correlations and factor analysis;

•	Creation of new movie genres based on emotions rather than contents using clustering algorithms;

•	Inspect what the emotions that affect most the rating are, using correlations and feature importance from XGBoost;

•	Working with real survey data supplied by MAGID on perceived emotional responses by the users and demographic data (age, income, etc.)

•	Customer segmentation looking at customer habits;

•	Using Python programming for clustering and building a model to predict good and bad ratings;
